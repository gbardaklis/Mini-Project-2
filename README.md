## Instructions on how to run our program:
1. using Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. open the MP2_FINAL_FINAL.ipynb in google colab
3. upload the required input text file 
4. under the "PuzzleParser Class" section change the file path to that of the desired input file
5. may need to do "pip install xlsxwriter" for the import xlsxwriter to function
6. now all cells can be ran in order and the corresponding files will be created

### Implementation

State Space Search, Input, and Output were all implemented in the one notebook and therefore running the entirety of the notebook will cover all three.
Analysis was also completed in this notebook and will thus also be covered during the run of the notebook.
